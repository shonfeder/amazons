* Main section

This part describes some information about stuff.

** A specific example

   Suppose we want to do such and such. Then we can:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
   let empty : t =
     let coord_values = (Aux.range 0 9) in
     let coords =
       List.map (fun x -> List.map (fun y -> (x, y)) coord_values) coord_values
       |> List.concat
     in
     List.map Sq.empty coords

   let square
     : t -> coord -> Sq.t
     = fun board coord' ->
       let square_with_coord Sq.{coord} = (coord = coord') in
       List.find square_with_coord board

   let select_square
     : coord -> t -> (Sq.t * t)
     = fun coord board ->
       let square = square board coord  in
       (square, List'.remove board square)
   #+END_SRC

   And that's how we would!
